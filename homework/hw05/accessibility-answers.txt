1. What corrections did you have to make?

The only corrections I had to make were adding the aria tags, and alt text. Wave didn't report any other issues.

2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

It depends on one's definition of usable. Can it provide all the same information? Yes. Does it provide it in a format that can be easily understood? No.
I would argue that the website is unusable if you turn off the CSS, although not totally lacking.

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yes.



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
